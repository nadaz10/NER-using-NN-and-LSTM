# Named Entity Recognition using Nerual Network (NN) and Longest-Short Term Memory (LSTM)

## Problem Description
Implement models for Named Entity Recognition (NER), which is the task of associating words in a sentence with their proper name tags. For example, "Marie Curie" may correspond to the tag PER (person), and "Princeton University" may correspond to the tag ORG (organization). The task involves using a total of 5 tags: PER, ORG, LOC, MISC, and O (non-entity).

## Programming Problem 1: Neural Network (NN) for NER
Completed the missing parts in the implemented neural networks (NN) for NER.
